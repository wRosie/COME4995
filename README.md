This is a Jupyter notebook extension to add availible syntax highlighting for cell magic. 

It is currently under development. The first release will come soon.

# Motivation
Cell magics in Jupyter Notebook is a popular way to expand the functionality of the notebook, and the SQL cell magic is widely used for executing SQL statements in the notebook. Though SQL command runs in the magic cell, the syntax highlighting of the magic commands remains the default IPython highlighting.

The project aims to provide an SQL syntax highlighting for the statements in cell magic. 

# Future development
The project might be expended to implement syntax highlights for other magic codes, for example, html.
